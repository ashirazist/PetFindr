## Introducing `PetFindr`


The goal of 'PetFindr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to extract data from https://www.petfinder.com/, which is the largest online pet adoption website, and to facilitate data analysis and other tasks from the extracted data.\

The package provides a useful tool to enable R users to search for their favorite pets in their own R session, and to browse pictures of the pets. All of this is possible thanks to API (Application Programming Interface) which is a set of instructions and standards for accessing structured information on the web. The Petfinder website provides us with an API that allows us to access the Petfinder database of hundreds of thousands of pets ready for adoption and over ten thousand animal welfare organizations. \

This vignette introduces and walks through the package,`PetFindr`, and the Petfinder API for authenticating and extracting data from the database.\


## Getting Started

First, install the  the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval= F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earl88/PetFindr")
```


Now load the package. 

```{r setup, eval = F}
library(PetFindr)
```


### Authentication

In order to begin, you need a secure authentication. \

To get your own `key` and `secret` from the API website, you have to create an account on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/user/register/).\

`pf_setup` function will guide you through whole process to initialize the API connection to Petfinder.\
Running this function will open a browser to "https://www.petfinder.com/developers/" and prompt you to register for Petfinder's API (V2).

```{r, eval = F}
pf_setup()

```


```{r out.width = "50%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/setup_message.png")
```


```{r, eval = F}
pf_save_credentials(key, secret)
````

Once you creat an account on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) and receive a unique `key` and a `secret`, you now can use the function `petfindr_save_credentials()` to store their key and secret to your .Rprofile so that you do not have to run `pf_save_credentials(key, secret)` everytime you use the package.\
Using `pf_save_credentials(key, secret)` makes it easier to access the API in the future, but this function is not required to access the database.  \


You're ALMOST ready to find pets! You have one more step to use `PetFindr'! \
In order to maintain security, you need an access token to request access to API database.\

```{r, eval = F}
pf_accesstoken(key, secret)
```

Once you use their key and secret as the inputs of `pf_accesstoken()`, you now have an access to the Petfinder servers and can start your own query to find your future pets. By the way, you should remember that the token has to be requested every hour.\


Now, The [Petfinder API v2.0](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) are now accessible through R! \ 
Let's find pets! \



 
## Usage


The Petfinder API allows users to search and view pet listings based on pet characteristics, location, and status. In addition, they can search for and display animal shelters based on the organization's name, ID, and location.\

The following section introduces the functions in `PetFindr` package and how to interact with the Petfinder API with some cute examples of extracting data from the database. \

The examples are mainly split into pet, shelter, photo-viewing functions.


### Functions


#### `pf_find_pets`

Retrieve a data frame of information about pets that are listed on Petfinder.com. \
Filter searches based on characteristics such as animal type, breed, size, age, or location.


#### `pf_list_breeds`

This function allows the user to specify an animal type found on Petfinder.com and returns a vector containing all available breeds for that animal type.



#### `pf_list_types`

This function returns the available animal types from Petfinder.com, along with each type's available coat, color, and gender options.


#### `pf_map_locations`

This function display animal locations.


#### `pf_find_organizations`

This function retrieves a data frame of information about organizations that are listed on Petfinder.com. Filter searches based on location by specifying a postal code, city and state, country, or latitude and longitude.

#### `pf_view_photos`

This function retrieves the photos of searched pets in a slideshow format.








### Examples Using Sample Data


The developers have stored sample datasets extracted from Petfinder, \
because it can be useful to include example datasets in the R package, to illustrate how the datasets are structures and how it can be leveraged to explore your interests in pets \

The datasets in the package are immediately available when the package is loaded.

#### Sample data: Puppies in Los Angeles

The dataset summarises information of 500 puppies in Greater Los Angeles area extracted from Petfinder on April 25, 2019. 
Output below is the first observation from the dataset.

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(PetFindr)
```

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
LA_puppies %>% head(n = 5) %>% select(id, organization_id, type, species, name,age,gender, size, status)
```

Note the output does not show every column in the sample dataset (otherwise the table would be very wide).

The first row from the sample data (column 1 above) represents:

- id: Animal ID
- organization_id : Organization Id
- url: url of the animal
- type : Type of the animal
- species: Species of the animal
- breeds.primary: Primary breed (if known)
- breeds.secondary: Secondary breed (if known)
- breeds.mixed: Is breed mixed? (TRUE if secondary breed exists)
- breeds.unknown: Is breed unknown?
- age: Age
- gender: Gender
- size : Size


#### Sample data: Shelters in New York State

The dataset summarises the list of animal sheters in New York State. \
Output below is the first observation from the dataset.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
NY_orgs %>% head(n = 5) %>% select(id, name, email, phone)
```

Note the output does not show every column in the sample dataset\
(otherwise the table would be very wide).



### Shiny

The Shiny is a convenient way to explore data through an interactive user interface in the user’s default browser straight from R. This section of the vignette will present a couple of examples to show users how to explore Petfinder using R Shiny.\

You also need an authentication to use the Shiny because Shiny extracts information from the API as well.\

The app includes multiple ways to extract and visualize data from Petfinder. All of the output on the Shiny app can be created directly in R as well. To run the app, load the `PetFindr` package, and run the `pf_run_Shiny()` function:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(PetFindr)
pf_run_Shiny()
```

The computer’s default browser will open up and display the following pages:

#### Authentication

```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/shiny_main.png")

```


To ensure that the users are registered and have their own  `key` and `secret`, the main page of the Shiny app 
shows a short instruction to let the users know that `key` and `secret` are required to use the Shiny app and the token has to be regenerated every hour..\

The shiny app also detects invalid `key` and `secret`.



#### Search by Animals

After you are granted to access the API, you can search animals as below. 


```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/shiny2.png")

```

The first tab is divided into 4 main sections:

The left sidebar is used to input the required information (location, search radius, types of animals, breeds of animals, adoption status, number of pets in the output) to request the AP to search for pets that meet certain criteria. 

`Pets in your location` is a table output that displays the list of pets from the output.

The main visualization display section shows a `leaflet` output to visualize the location of the pets. 

Finally, if you click one of the rows in `Pets in your location` table, app will show you a picture of the selected animal. If the photo is unavailable, it will return an error message.  



#### Search by Organizations

Second tab allows you to find information on animal shelters and is also dicided into 4 main sections.\

You can search organization based on 3 criteria (location, search radius , and number of outputs) and \
the left sidebar shows the input section.\

The main visualization display show three types of information.\
First, it shows a `leaflet` to visualize the location of the animal shelters,\
and the table below shows information from a selected shelter in the `leaflet`.\
Finally, the bar graph summarizes the types and number of pets in the selected shelter. 


```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/orginfo.png")

```
