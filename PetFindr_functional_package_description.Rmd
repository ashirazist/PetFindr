## Introduction
The purpose of this short report is to give the readers a short view of what they are going to see and use in the package called PetFindr.\

The idea comes from the well-known website [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) where people can adopt pets. In this package we are providing a tool to enable R users to search for their favorite pets through their own R session and make queries and then get the photos of searched pets on their R machine. The key that makes this possible is using API (Application Programming Interface) which is a set of instructions and standards for accessing structured information on the web. Luckily, the Petfinder website provides us with API which allows us to access the Petfinder database of hundreds of thousands of pets ready for adoption and over ten thousand animal welfare organizations. \

The benefits of PetFinder API is that users can search for and display pet listings based on pet characteristics, location, and status. In addition, they can search for and display animal welfare organizations based on organization name, ID, and location. Furthermore, this API uses predictable URLs to access resources and, in case of an error, returns meaningful HTTP response codes.The API also supports cross-origin resource sharing, which allows you to use it securely from a client-side web application. You use the API by sending requests with a specific structure to Petfinder servers. In order to maintain security, it uses access tokens for API requests.\

With this structured API, what is required to be taken into consideration in PetFindr package is first the structure of how getting access to users' account on the website to get their `key` and `secret` which allow any user to use the API and start a query. This key and secret are unique for any valid account on the website.


#### PetFindr_setup()
The first function which should be used after loading the package is `PetFindr_setup`. This asks the user if they already have an account on the website or if they prefer to make an account at the moment. After registering, any individual is assigned to a `key` and a `secret`  which can be used to generate a token using the function  `petfindr_accesstoken`. 


#### petfindr_save_credentials(key, secret)
Once users create an accounton [PetFinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) and get their key and secret, they can use the function `petfindr_save_credentials` to save their key and secret to their Rprofile so that they do not have to input their key and secret for next time they load the package, and the package detect their information to use the PetFinder API. Then user's  credentials will be avaiable in their Global Environment after restarting RStudio. Using this function makes things easier for future access to the API, but this is not something necessarry for running and using the package. 


#### petfindr_accesstoken(key, secret)
Once credidentials are set up, users can use them to request an access token. This token will enable users to receive information from PetFInder servers to their R session. Once users use their key and secret as the inputs of `petfindr_accesstoken`, they gain access to to the PetFinder servers and can start their query about their favorite pets. An important point is that their access token lasts for one hour (3600 seconds). After that time, you will need to g request a new one and use that.\
