## Introducing `PetFindr`


The goal of 'PetFindr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to extract data from https://www.petfinder.com/, which is the largest online pet adoption website, and to facilitate data analysis and other tasks from the extracted data.\

The package provides a useful tool to enable R users to search for their favorite pets in their own R session, and to browse pictures of the pets. All of this is possible thanks to API (Application Programming Interface) which is a set of instructions and standards for accessing structured information on the web. The Petfinder website provides us with an API that allows us to access the Petfinder database of hundreds of thousands of pets ready for adoption and over ten thousand animal welfare organizations. \

This vignette introduces and walks through the package,`PetFindr`, and the Petfinder API for authenticating and extracting data from the database.\


## Getting Started

First, install the  the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval= F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earl88/PetFindr")
```


Now load the package. 

```{r setup, eval = F}
library(PetFindr)
```


### Authentication

In order to begin, you need a secure authentication. \

To get your own `key` and `secret` from the API website, you have to create an account on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/user/register/).\

`pf_setup` function will guide you through whole process to initialize the API connection to Petfinder.\
Running this function will open a browser to "https://www.petfinder.com/developers/" and prompt you to register for Petfinder's API (V2).

```{r, eval = F}
pf_setup()

```


```{r out.width = "70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/setup_message.png")
```

If a user responsds "yes", `pf_setup` will load PetFinder register website into an HTML browser. \
After registration, a Petfinder API Key and Secret can be requested in www.petfinder.com/developers. \


```{r  out.width = "85%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/getanapi.png")
```


A user gets a uniqe `key` and `secret` and these will be used to request an access token to Petfinder API. 

```{r  out.width = "85%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/secretandkey.png")
```


```{r, eval = F}
pf_save_credentials(key, secret)
````

Once you creat an account on [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) and receive a unique `key` and a `secret`, you now can use the function `petfindr_save_credentials()` to store their key and secret to your .Rprofile so that you do not have to run `pf_save_credentials(key, secret)` everytime you use the package.\
Using `pf_save_credentials(key, secret)` makes it easier to access the API in the future, but this function is not required to access the database.  \


You're ALMOST ready to find pets! You have one more step to use `PetFindr'! \
In order to maintain security, you need an access token to request access to API database.\

```{r, eval = F}
pf_accesstoken(key, secret)
```

Once you use their key and secret as the inputs of `pf_accesstoken()`, you now have an access to the Petfinder servers and can start your own query to find your future pets. By the way, you should remember that the token has to be requested every hour.\


Now, The [Petfinder API v2.0](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) are now accessible through R!\ 
Let's find pets! \



 
## Usage


The Petfinder API allows users to search and view pet listings based on pet characteristics, location, and status. In addition, they can search for and display animal shelters based on the organization's name, ID, and location.\

The following section introduces the functions in `PetFindr` package and how to interact with the Petfinder API with some cute examples of extracting data from the database. \

The examples are mainly split into pet, shelter, photo-viewing functions.


### Functions


#### `pf_find_pets`

Retrieve a data frame of information about pets that are listed on Petfinder.com. \
Filter searches based on characteristics such as animal type, breed, size, age, or location. \


List of input arguments can be found [here](https://earl88.github.io/PetFindr/reference/index.html) \

Let's say a user would like to find a list of female cats in Austin, Texas. \
In the following example, only few variable are shown unless the output will be very wide. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
pf_find_pets(token, type = "cat", gender = "female", location = "Austin, TX", page = 1) %>% select(organization_id, type, breeds.primary, age, gender, size, name, status) %>% head(n = 5)
```

```{r  out.width = "85%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/pf_find_pets.png")
```
### List types and breeds of pets 

Two functions `pf_list_types` and `pf_list_breeds` return a list of all available types and breeds of pets available on the Petfinder API. Seraching for specific types or breeds might be a waste of time when users can list all available information about types and breeds in their R session. Since there is also a daily limitation for making queries to the API, these two functions make things easier. 
#### `pf_list_types`

This function returns the available animal types from Petfinder.com, along with each type's available coat, color, and gender options. There is only one argument required for this function which is user's `token`. Then a tibble listing all available types with thier respective coat, color, and gender is returned by this function. 
```{r}
pf_list_types(token = token)
pf_list_types(token = token)$names

```

Anytime users call for the type of pets, the function makes a query to the API and lists all types of pets based on the latest information. There is also a list of types of pets available in the package called `pf_types` which can be used; however, this data set is not up-to-date and it is just an example data set.

```{r}
data("pf_types", package = "PetFindr")
```



#### `pf_list_breeds`

This function gets all available breeds of each specific type of pet listed in users' R session  and allows the user to specify an animal type found on Petfinder.com and returns a vector containing all available breeds for that animal type. Similar to `pf_list_type`, users' token is required for this function as the first input. The type of the pet must be also specified by the users. In return, a character vector containing the breed names for the specified animal type is given by the function. 

```{r, message=TRUE}
# error animal type must be specified
pf_list_breeds(token = token)
```


```{r}
pf_list_breeds(token = token, type = "Scales, Fins & Other")

```


```{r}
# Listing all available dog "Retriever" 
dog_breeds <- pf_list_breeds(token = token, type = "dog")
dog_breeds[stringr::str_detect(dog_breeds, pattern = "Retriever") == TRUE]
```

Similar to `pf_types` dataset, there is also an example data set of pet breeds available in the package called `pf_breeds` which can be used; however, to have the most recent breeds listed in R, `pf_list_breeds` needs to be called.



#### `pf_map_locations`

This function display animal locations.


#### `pf_find_organizations`

This function retrieves a data frame of information about organizations that are listed on Petfinder.com. Filter searches based on location by specifying a postal code, city and state, country, or latitude and longitude.

#### `pf_view_photos`

This function retrieves the photos of searched pets in a slideshow format.








### Examples Using Sample Data


The developers have stored sample datasets extracted from Petfinder, \
because it can be useful to include example datasets in the R package, to illustrate how the datasets are structures and how it can be leveraged to explore your interests in pets \

The datasets in the package are immediately available when the package is loaded.

#### Sample data: Puppies in Los Angeles

The dataset summarises information of 500 puppies in Greater Los Angeles area extracted from Petfinder on April 25, 2019. 
Output below is the first observation from the dataset.

```{r, echo = F, eval = T, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(PetFindr)
```

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
LA_puppies %>% head(n = 5) %>% select(id, organization_id, type, species, name,age,gender, size, status)
```

Note the output does not show every column in the sample dataset (otherwise the table would be very wide).

Detailed information on the variables can be found [here](https://earl88.github.io/PetFindr/reference/index.html)

Using the data, a user can perform various kinds of explanatory data analysis.
For example, if a user wants to know what breed is the most common breed of dogs can be found in Los Angeles area. 
Top 10 breeds in Los Angeles area on April 2019 would be

```{r}
names(sort(-table(LA_puppies$breeds.primary)))[1:10]
```

The result can also be visualized as below.


```{r, message = F, echo = T, eval = F}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}

top10 <- LA_puppies %>% filter(breeds.primary %in% c("Chihuahua","Terrier","German Shepherd Dog","Labrador Retriever" ,"Pug" ,"Shepherd", "Maltese" ,"Dachshund" ,"Pit Bull Terrier","Husky" ))

## Reorder puppies by frequency

top10 <- within(top10, 
                   breeds.primary <- factor(breeds.primary, 
                                      levels=names(sort(table(breeds.primary), 
                                                        decreasing=TRUE))))

## Create a bar plot

top10 %>% ggplot(aes(x = breeds.primary, fill = gender)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()
```


```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/commonbreeds.png")
```

Through visualization, the user can conclude that these are the most common puppy breeds (top 10) found at LA animal shelters.

Or, a user can conduct a time series analysis. Let's create a time series plot to see when the animals are posted on Petfinder.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}


## Create a time variable
LA_puppies$published_at <- lubridate::date(ymd_hms(LA_puppies$published_at))

LA_puppies %>% group_by(published_at) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = published_at, y = n)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + ggtitle("Time Series of Animal Posting in LA") +
           xlab("Date") + ylab("Number of Postings")
```

```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/nyorgstimeseries.png")
```

#### Sample data: Shelters in New York State

The dataset summarises the list of animal sheters in New York State. \
Output below is the first observation from the dataset.

```{r, eval = T, echo = T}
NY_orgs %>% head(n = 5) %>% select(id, name, email, phone)
```

Note the output does not show every column in the sample dataset (otherwise the table would be very wide).

Detailed information on the variables can be found [here](https://earl88.github.io/PetFindr/reference/index.html)

Similar explanatory analysis can be conducted for the dataset as well.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
top10_orgs <- NY_orgs %>% filter(address.city %in% c("New York","Brooklyn","Rochester", "Albany",        "Staten Island", "Buffalo" ,"Flushing","Binghamton","Syracuse","Bronx"))

top10_orgs <- within(top10_orgs, 
                   address.city <- factor(address.city, 
                                      levels=names(sort(table(address.city), 
                                                        decreasing=TRUE))))
top10_orgs %>% ggplot(aes(x = address.city)) + geom_bar() + coord_flip()
```


```{r  out.width = "80%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/sheltersinny.png")
```



The bar plot indicates that most of the shelters in New York state is located in New York city. 



### Shiny

The Shiny is a convenient way to explore data through an interactive user interface in the user’s default browser straight from R. This section of the vignette will present a couple of examples to show users how to explore Petfinder using R Shiny.\
Detailed information on R Shiny could be found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

You also need an authentication to use the Shiny because Shiny extracts information from the API as well.\

The app includes multiple ways to extract and visualize data from Petfinder. All of the output on the Shiny app can be created directly in R as well. To run the app, load the `PetFindr` package, and run the `pf_run_Shiny()` function:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
library(PetFindr)
library(shiny)
pf_run_Shiny()
```

The computer’s default browser will open up and display the following pages:

#### Authentication

```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/shiny_main.png")

```


To ensure that the users are registered and have their own  `key` and `secret`, the main page of the Shiny app 
shows a short instruction to let the users know that `key` and `secret` are required to use the Shiny app and the token has to be regenerated every hour..\

The shiny app also detects invalid `key` and `secret`.



#### Search by Animals

After you are granted to access the API, you can search animals as below. 


```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/shiny2.png")

```

The first tab is divided into 4 main sections:

The left sidebar is used to input the required information (location, search radius, types of animals, breeds of animals, adoption status, number of pets in the output) to request the AP to search for pets that meet certain criteria. 

`Pets in your location` is a table output that displays the list of pets from the output.

The main visualization display section shows a `leaflet` output to visualize the location of the pets. 

Finally, if you click one of the rows in `Pets in your location` table, app will show you a picture of the selected animal. If the photo is unavailable, it will return an error message.  



#### Search by Organizations

Second tab allows you to find information on animal shelters and is also dicided into 4 main sections.\

You can search organization based on 3 criteria (location, search radius , and number of outputs) and \
the left sidebar shows the input section.\

The main visualization display show three types of information.\
First, it shows a `leaflet` to visualize the location of the animal shelters,\
and the table below shows information from a selected shelter in the `leaflet`.\
Finally, the bar graph summarizes the types and number of pets in the selected shelter. 


```{r out.width = "70%", eval = T, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earl88/PetFindr/master/inst/FinalPresentation/images/orginfo.png")

```
